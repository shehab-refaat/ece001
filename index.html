	<h1 >Introduction to java </h1> 
	
	<p > Java is a general-purpose programming language this is elegance-primarily based, item-orientated and built to have as few dependencies as possible on implementation. It is intendedto permit application builders to jot down once, run anywhere which means that compiled Java code can run on all Java-helping platforms without recompilation.[  Java programs are typically compiled to bytecode That can run on any digital Java gadget (JVM), no matter the underlying laptop architecture. Java's syntax is similar to C and C++, but it does have fewer low-level facilities than either. As of 2019, Java changed into considered one of GitHub's maximum common programming language], with a stated nine million developers , especially for client-server web packages.<p>
Each personal computer has a microprocessor that manages the computer's arithmetical, logical, and control activities
</p>
	<p>Java programming language was at first developed through Sun Microsystems and turned intobrought by means of James Gosling and published as the core aspect of the Java platform (Java 1.zero [J2SE]) of Sun Microsystems in 1995.Java Standard Edition new replace is Java SE 8. With the advent of Java and its massive popularity, several configurations had been constructedto healthy distinct platform styles. For instance J2EE for Enterprise Applications, J2ME for Mobile Applications</p>

	<h1>java is </h1>
	
	<ol>Object Oriented
	<p>Everything in Java is an Object. Java may be without problems prolonged as it's far based totally on the model of an Object.

</p></li>
	<li >	Application Independent <p>
		Unlike many other programming languages, along with C and C++, it is not compiled into platform-particular machines whilst Java is compiled, but rather into platform-particular byte code. This byte code is shipped at the net and read via the the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it's miles being run on.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li > Simple:<p>Java is designed to be smooth to learn. If you recognize the basic idea of OOP Java, it might be easy to master.</p>
	</li>
	<li >	Secure<p>With Java's secure feature it enables to expand virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication strategies are based on public-key encryption.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Architecture-impartial <p>
		 Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object report format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime device.
	</p> </li>
	<li>Portable
		<p>Being architecture-impartial and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java transportable. Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with a cleanportability boundary, that is a POSIX subset.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Robust
	<p>Java makes an effort to take away blunders prone conditions by way of emphasizing particularly on collect time errors checking and runtime checking</p></li>
	<li>Multithreaded
	<p>With Java's multithreaded function it is feasible to put in writing applicationsthat can perform many duties simultaneously. This design characteristic permits the builders to assemble interactive programs which could run smoothly</p></li>
	<li>Interpreted
	<p>Java byte code is translated at the fly to native gadget instructions and isn'tstored anywhere. The development system is extra speedy and analytical because the linking is an incremental and light-weight technique.</p></li>
	<li>High Performance
	<p>With the use of Just-In-Time compilers, Java enables high performance.</p></li>
	<li>Distributed
	<p>Java is designed for the distributed environment of the internet.</p></li>
	<li>Dynamic
	<p>Java is taken into consideration to be more dynamic than C or C++ since it's milesdesigned to conform to an evolving surroundings. Java packages can carry tremendousquantity of run-time statistics that may be used to verify and resolve accesses to gadgets on run-time</p></li>
